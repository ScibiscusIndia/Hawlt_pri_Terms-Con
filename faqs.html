        <strong>Yes, you can get refund.</strong> Window for requesting for refund is opened for next 48 hours after completing the payment. 
        You can mail a request to support@hawlt.com <br>

        1. Review the refund policy: Check the terms and conditions, refund policy, or any documentation related to the product or service you purchased. Understand the conditions under which refunds are provided, such as time limits, eligibility criteria, or specific circumstances. <br>
        2. Contact customer support: Reach out to the customer support of the company or platform from which you made the purchase. Look for contact information on their website or in the purchase confirmation email. Explain your situation, provide necessary details such as order number, purchase date, and any relevant information to support your refund request. <br>
        3. State your reason: Clearly explain why you are requesting a refund. It could be due to a defective or unsatisfactory product, billing error, or any other valid reason as per the refund policy. Be polite and provide any supporting evidence or documentation, if applicable. <br>
        4. Follow the instructions: The customer support representative will guide you through the refund process. They may ask for additional information or provide specific steps to follow. It's important to follow their instructions and provide any requested details promptly. <br>
        5. Document communication: Keep a record of all communication with customer support, including dates, names of representatives, and details of the conversation. This can be useful in case there are any issues or disputes later on. <br>
        6. Escalate if necessary: If you are not getting a satisfactory response or your refund request is being denied without a valid reason, you may need to escalate the matter. Ask to speak to a supervisor or inquire about the company's escalation process. In some cases, you may need to contact your bank or credit card company to dispute the charge. <br>
